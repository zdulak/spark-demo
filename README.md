# spark-demo

* Below are my solutions for the first week of learning the Spark at the Scala Academy. 
* The class SparkDemo contains our first Spark application which loads file to a DataFrame
* The Wed class contain solution of the following exercise:
    1. Load CSV file
    2. Dataset.withColumn + functions object
       - https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/functions$.html
       - Values should all be UPPER case
    3. DataFrame.show
